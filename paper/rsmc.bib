	title = {On the limits of real-time physical modelling synthesis with a modular environment},
	abstract = {One goal of physical modelling synthesis is the creation of new virtual instruments. Modular approaches, whereby a set of basic primitive elements can be connected to form a more complex instrument have a long history in audio synthesis. This paper examines such modular methods using ﬁnite difference schemes, within the constraints of real-time audio systems. Focusing on consumer hardware and the application of parallel programming techniques for CPU processors, useable combinations of 1D and 2D objects are demonstrated. These can form the basis for a modular synthesis environment that is implemented in a standard plug-in architecture such as an Audio Unit, and controllable via a MIDI keyboard. Optimisation techniques such as vectorization and multi-threading are examined in order to maximise the performance of these computationally demanding systems.},

	abstract = {The digital emulation of analog audio effects and synthesis components, through the simulation of lumped circuit components has seen a large amount of activity in recent years; electromechanical effects have seen rather less, primarily because they employ distributed mechanical components, which are not easily dealt with in a rigorous manner using typical audio processing constructs such as delay lines and digital ﬁlters. Spring reverberation is an example of such a system—a spring exhibits complex, highly dispersive behavior, including coupling between different types of wave propagation (longitudinal and transverse). Standard numerical techniques, such as ﬁnite difference schemes are a good match to such a problem, but require specialized design and analysis techniques in the context of audio processing. A model of helical spring vibration is introduced, along with a family of ﬁnite difference schemes suitable for time domain simulation. Various topics are covered, including numerical stability conditions, tuning of the scheme to the response of the model system, numerical boundary conditions and connection to an excitation and readout, implementation details, as well as computational requirements. Simulation results are presented, and full energy-based stability analysis appears in an Appendix.},

Ensuring numerical stability is thus a major consideration. In general, one may construct implicit schemes using well-known discretisation methods such as the trapezoid rule, requiring computationallycostly iterative solvers at each time step. Here, a novel family of provably numerically stable time-stepping schemes is presented, avoiding the need for iterative solvers, and thus of greatly reduced computational cost.

	abstract = {We present a method that generates passive-guaranteed stable simulations of analog audio circuits from electronic schematics for real-time issues. On one hand, this method is based on a continuous-time power-balanced state-space representation structured into its energy-storing parts, dissipative parts, and external sources. On the other hand, a numerical scheme is especially designed to preserve this structure and the power balance. These state-space structures deﬁne the class of port-Hamiltonian systems. The derivation of this structured system associated with the electronic circuit is achieved by an automated analysis of the interconnection network combined with a dictionary of models for each elementary component. The numerical scheme is based on the combination of ﬁnite differences applied on the state (with respect to the time variable) and on the total energy (with respect to the state). This combination provides a discrete-time version of the power balance. This set of algorithms is valid for both the linear and nonlinear case. Finally, three applications of increasing complexities are given: a diode clipper, a common-emitter bipolar-junction transistor ampliﬁer, and a wah pedal. The results are compared to ofﬂine simulations obtained from a popular circuit simulator.},

We present the basic theory and a discussion on possible extensions for each modelling technique. For some methods, a simple model example is chosen from the existing literature demonstrating a typical use of the method. For instance, in the case of the digital waveguide modelling technique a vibrating string model is discussed, and in the case of the wave digital ﬁlter technique we present a classical piano hammer model. We tackle some nonlinear and time-varying models and include new results on the digital waveguide modelling of a nonlinear string.

In this paper, large scale time stepping methods, such as the ﬁnite difference time domain and ﬁnite volume time domain methods are explored for a variety of systems of interest in musical acoustics, including brass instruments, percussion instruments based on thin plate and shell vibration, and also their embeddings in 3D acoustic spaces. Attention is paid here to implementation issues, particularly on parallel hardware, which is well-suited to time stepping methods operating over regular grids. Sound examples are presented.},

	title = {Modeling methods for the highly dispersive {Slinky} spring: {A} novel musical toy},
	abstract = {The ’Slinky’ spring is a popular and beloved toy for many children. Like its smaller relatives, used in spring reverberation units, it can produce interesting sonic behaviors. We explore the behavior of the ’Slinky’ spring via measurement, and discover that its sonic characteristics are notably different to those of smaller springs. We discuss methods of modeling the behavior of a Slinky via the use of ﬁnite-difference techniques and digital waveguides. We then apply these models in different structures to build a number of interesting tools for computer-based music production.},
