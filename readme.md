# Applied Physical Modeling: The Yaybahar

This repository contains the code of a C++ application that implements a physical
modeling sound synthesis algorithm that models the Yaybahar

The Yaybahar is a novel acoustical instrument created by Turkish artist Görkem Sen.
It consists of a string that is connected to two springs that connect to two drum
membranes. This produces a distinctive reverbarant sound.
